This is a demo to show usage of my [fork](https://github.com/Alan052918/node-dependency-tree) of dependents/node-dependency-tree.

Noted that the `filename` and `directory` used in [index.js](https://github.com/Alan052918/Package-Dependency-Scaling-Analysis/blob/master/deptree/index.js) is on my local filesystem, and my fork of `dependency-tree` is not yet available on npm, so programs in this folder will not run on any other computers, it is just for demonstration's purpose.

The result can be viewed in [dependency-tree-output.txt](https://github.com/Alan052918/Package-Dependency-Scaling-Analysis/blob/master/deptree/dependency-tree-output.txt).
